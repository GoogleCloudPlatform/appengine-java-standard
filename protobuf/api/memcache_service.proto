//
// If anything in this document is unclear, refer to the official
// memcached protocol specs, which this service attempts to mimic:
//   http://code.sixapart.com/svn/memcached/tags/1.2.4/doc/protocol.txt
//
// These stubby definitions are closely related to those from
// google3/cacheserving/memcacheg/proto/rpc.proto, but differ in a few ways:
//    * intended to be visible to external developers
//    * missing some functionality that may be available in memcacheg, allowing
//      memcacheg to move independently from memcache API.
//    * the name_space fields exposed here are used to build
//      the namespace, but do not specify it completely.  The app_id is
//      used as the top level namespace, and name_space is immediately below.
//      If the name_space field is "", it is mapped to the app's root namespace.
