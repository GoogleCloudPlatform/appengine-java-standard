// NOTE: All of the message definitions below should be considered
// strawman proposals. As our design is refined, many of these messages will
// be fleshed out. At this time, do not take any of them to be finalized.
// As the formal message type (linked below) is finalized, ideally we remove
// this file in favor of that interface.
//
// see:
// <internal16>
//
// We may discover that the use of protocol buffers to represent events is too
// heavyweight for the throughput we require. In that case, all of these
// messages may be thrown out in favor of a custom encoding.
//
// For now, these messages have been defined in favor of readability and
// debuggability. Even if we use protocol messages to represent our events,
// it's likely that some of these definitions will change to reduce time and
// space overhead.
//
// To optimize the binary encoding for these messages, fields that will be
// present in all message instances should use tags from 1 to 15 (one byte to
// encode). Fields that are not present in every message should use tags from
// 16 to 2047 (two bytes to encode).
