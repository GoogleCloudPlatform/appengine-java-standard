/**

 * pooled thread is in its own {@link ThreadGroup}.  Unfortunately
 * threads cannot be moved around between thread groups, so we just
 * pool (ThreadGroup, Thread) pairs.  If additional threads are
 * started in a thread group, they are expected to have exited before
 * the runnable provided to {@link #start} completes.  If this is not
 * the case, the thread will be dropped from the thread pool and
 * detailed diagnostics will be written to the log.
 *
 * <p>Unlike thread names, thread group names are immutable so thread
 * groups will be named with a specified prefix with a counter
 * appended.  The name of the main thread for each thread pool is
 * determined when {@link #start} is called.
