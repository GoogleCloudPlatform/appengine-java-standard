/**
 * Provides a service to send email messages on behalf of administrators or authenticated users,
 * also accessible via a <a
 * href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html">JavaMail</a> interface.
 * Receiving messages is not supported via the JavaMail API but is supported via <a
 * href="http://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/mail/receiving.html">an HTTP interface</a>.
 *
 * <p>This low-level API is intended primarily for framework authors. For application developers we
 * provide a custom {@code javax.mail.Transport} that allows the standard {@code javax.mail}
 * interface to be used to send emails. No special configuration is required to send emails via this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>The {@link com.google.appengine.api.mail.MailService.Message} class represents a message,
 * including sender and recipient information, and possibly attachments as {@link
 * com.google.appengine.api.mail.MailService.Attachment} objects. These can be independently created
 * via their respective constructors.
 *
 * <p>Sending a message requires a {@link com.google.appengine.api.mail.MailService} object, created
 * by the {@link com.google.appengine.api.mail.MailServiceFactory}. Messages are sent
 * asynchronously, so the {@code MailService} methods will
 * always succeed immediately. Any errors in the mail message will be returned to the sender's
 * address as "bounce" messages.
 *

 * @see <a href="http://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/mail/">The Mail Java API in the
 *     <em>Google App Engine Developer's Guide</em></a>
